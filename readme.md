I would say I am best with html, then js, then css. tweaking and messing around with css always takes me forever and is the part I usually enjoy the least. Id like to think I am pretty good at making well-formed semantic html. I am just ok with js.

My strength resides in design and css. HTML I am proficient in, however, my JS needs much improvement.
