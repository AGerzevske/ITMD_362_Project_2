I would say I am best with html, then js, then css. tweaking and messing around with css always takes me forever and is the part I usually enjoy the least. Id like to think I am pretty good at making well-formed semantic html. I am just ok with js.

My strength resides in design and css. HTML I am proficient in, however, my JS needs much improvement.

I believe that my strengths are in making a site that is relatively dynamic and
scales well to desktop and mobile.  I think that I am also decent at choosing
basic colors and designing a site that does not look to bad for someone who is
not an artist.
