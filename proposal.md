Our group booking system will be designed as an online event registration for
an IT Security community involved in career networking and professional events. These
events include IT security conferences, social nights, talks by field experts and group
discussions.

exploit_Disrupt is a working title for the community.

Sign-up fields will include:
  - Name, Age (must be 21 or older)
  - chosen listed event
  - number of tickets
  - available seats
  - mailing address
